    abstract = { CMAS, a category of atmospheric debris, causes erosion of thermal barrier coatings in aircraft engines. The CMAS melts, and infiltrates the microstructure of these coatings. Understanding this infiltration process is key to develop methods to prevent infiltration and mitigate damage to the coating. Conventional wisdom classifies the infiltration process as a capillary-driven flow. To evaluate this conventional wisdom, the process was directly resolved numerically using a finite-volume, multiphase, volume-of-fluid simulation. Results from this simulation method were compared to experiments and analytical models. Results show that the Ohnesorge Number drives the equilibrium point of the capillary-driven flow, where larger Ohnesorge Number lead to shorter infiltration depth. The results disagreed with experiments and the analytical pipe models, but agreed well with a differential equation model based on capillary flow in a rectangular microchannel, and a new proposed model that is tuned specifically for feathery coating geometries. This finding supports the idea that capillary flow is not the only dominant feature in the infiltration process, and other phenomenon, such as chemical processes, may have first-order effects on the flow physics. However, these findings highlight the fact that, if materials scientists can find a way to increase the effective viscosity of the infiltrating material, they can reduce infiltration depth, and preserve the coating for longer. }

Customized microchannels of varying geometric principles were fabricated in silicon and steel. In order to characterize the process efficiency of microchannel geometries, the effects of the process parameters (mean velocity, Reynolds number, and local pressure drop) were examined and correlated to the dispersion and emulsification results. It is demonstrated that high pressure losses focused at a small channel length and high velocity gradients lead to high stress intensities and, in consequence, to low particle or droplet sizes. Thus, 2D orifices were successfully further improved regarding their process efficiency by adding a third-dimension constriction.},

The cavitation regime is characterized using laser light induced luminescence. Droplet deformation and breakup events are compared to a cavitation-free flow with the same specific energy input.

ABSTRACT = {In the reduced acceleration environment aboard orbiting spacecraft, capillary forces are often exploited to access and control the location and stability of fuels, propellants, coolants, and biological liquids in containers (tanks) for life support. To access the ‘far reaches’ of such tanks, the passive capillary pumping mechanism of interior corner networks can be employed to achieve high levels of draining. With knowledge of maximal corner drain rates, gas ingestion can be avoided and accurate drain transients predicted. In this paper, we benchmark a numerical method for the symmetric draining of capillary liquids in simple interior corners. The free surface is modeled through a volume of fluid (VOF) algorithm via interFoam, a native OpenFOAM solver. The simulations are compared with rare space experiments conducted on the International Space Station. The results are also buttressed by simplified analytical predictions where practicable. The fact that the numerical model does well in all cases is encouraging for further spacecraft tank draining applications of significantly increased geometric complexity and fluid inertia.},

The jet is produced after a spherical shock wave emitted from a micro-explosion created by a focused laser pulse is refocused on the opposite side of its source. The analysis of high-speed videos of the liquid jet formation revealed that it originates from a larger, prolate cavitation bubble created by the strong tension produced after the reflection of the original wave on the air–liquid interface. The shock wave propagation and jet formation are modeled separately with finite volume simulations in OpenFOAM. Initially we study the pressure evolution inside the drop by comparing the numerical simulations with the distribution of bubbles nucleated after the passage of the negative pressure wave. The jet formation dynamics is explained by comparing the experiments with numerical results. The jet velocity is higher if the laser focus is closer to the drop surface.}

abstract="Acoustic cavitation is the formation and subsequent violent collapse of bubbles in liquid irradiated with intense ultrasound. Ultrasound is radiated by a vibrating plate connected to ultrasonic transducers made of piezoelectric materials driven by electrical power. Microscopic mechanism for vibration of piezoelectric materials is briefly described. There are two types of ultrasonic experimental equipment used to generate acoustic cavitation: ultrasonic horn (or probe) and ultrasonic bath. Ultrasonic standing waves and traveling waves are discussed by means of mathematical equations. Acoustic impedance is discussed, and transmission and reflection coefficients are described. Various types of acoustic cavitations are discussed: transient and stable cavitations, vaporous and gaseous cavitations. Fluctuations in degassing and re-gassing cause repeated change between vaporous and gaseous cavitation. Light emission associated with violent bubble collapse as well as chemical reactions inside and outside a bubble is discussed in the sections entitled ``sonoluminescence'' and ``sonochemistry,'' respectively. Unsolved problems in sonoluminescence are briefly discussed. Reasons for lesser amount of produced H radicals (H{\textperiodcentered}) than that of OH radicals (OH{\textperiodcentered}) in sonochemical reactions are discussed based on results generated from numerical simulations. In the last section, ultrasonic cleaning, especially for the application to silicon wafers, is discussed.",

De nombreuses lois d'état existent (Van der Waals par exemple) et considèrent les fluides comme un mélange et non comme des phases séparées hors d'équilibre, ce qui les rend inadaptées à ce type de modèles. De plus, leur formulation conduit à un problème au niveau des états thermodynamiques à l'intérieur du dôme de saturation (vitesse du son au carré négative). Dans notre approche, chaque fluide pur est régit par une loi d'état de type « Stiffened Gas » dont la formulation contient les principales propriétés de chaque fluide pur : les effets d'attraction et de répulsion moléculaires. La détermination des paramètres associés est complexifiée lorsque le liquide est en présence de sa vapeur. Dans ce cas, les coefficients sont fortement liés. La détermination des formes analytiques des lois d'état ainsi que de leurs paramètres pour des fluides miscibles et non miscibles fait l'objet du présent article. Des comparaisons sont effectuées par rapport aux données expérimentales et montrent un excellent accord.
Some two-phase flow models have shown an excellent ability for the resolution of a wide class of applications ranging from interface problems to mixtures with several velocities. These models account for waves propagation (acoustic and convective) and consist in hyperbolic systems of partial differential equations. In this context, each phase is compressible and necessitates the knowledge of an appropriate pure fluid equation of state. The litterature abounds in equations of state (Van der Waals for example) that consider the phases as a mixture and not as a separated phases flow in thermodynamical non-equilibrium, which makes them unsuited to such models. Moreover, their formulation leads to ill-posed problems for thermodynamic states inside the saturation dome (speed of sound squared is negative). In the present approach, each fluid is governed by a ‘Stiffened Gas’ EOS (3). Its particularly simple analytical form allows explicit mathematical calculations of important flow relations which are at the centre of theoretical analysis and building of modern numerical methods (acoustic properties, Riemann problems, reactive Riemann solvers, …) while retaining with a high accuracy the main physical properties of the matter (attractive and repulsive molecular effects). The determination of the corresponding parameters is complexified when the liquid is in presence of its vapor. In this case, the EOS parameters of each phase are strongly linked. The determination of the analytical forms of the EOS and their associated coefficients for miscible and non-miscible fluids is the subject of this article.}

abstract = {The present study reports a theoretical investigation of capillary transport of microbead suspension in microfluidic channels with finite size reservoirs at the inlet. The reservoir–microchannel combination is often the case in Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC) where biomolecules are transported using capillary force. To demonstrate such finite reservoir effect, the reservoir is placed vertically above the microchannel. Under such condition, the pressure field expression at the rectangular microchannel inlet is deduced. Appropriate correlations for effective physical properties are used to account for the presence of microbeads in the working fluid, mimicking biomolecules in actual LOC. The non-dimensional governing equation for capillary flow with finite size reservoir is derived based on the balance among the surface, viscous and gravity forces acting on the fluid front. The numerical solution of governing equation is obtained to investigate the impact of several operating parameters on the flow front progression. It is observed that the aspect ratio of the microchannel and reservoir play vital roles in deciding the behavior and magnitude of flow front progression in the microfluidic channels. Capillarity and gravity force dominant regions during the progression is observed. The microchannel width and reservoir width decide the interplay between gravity and capillarity. Although higher fluid level in the reservoir has an added advantage for more gravitational head, the resistance from the reservoir makes the flow front progress slowly at the beginning of the capillary transport. It is also found that microbead volume fraction in the working fluid plays an important role in delaying the capillary transport under various operating conditions. Hence, it can be concluded that the use of reservoir at the inlet of microfluidic channels has an impact on the overall capillary transport of biomolecules in LOC devices.}

Four different numerical approaches are compared for the rise of liquid, also providing reference data being of high relevance for capillarity-dominated wetting processes. The used methods are an Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian method (OpenFOAM solver interTrackFoam), a geometric Volume of Fluid code (FS3D), an algebraic Volume of Fluid method (OpenFOAM solver interFoam), and a level-set based extended discontinuous Galerkin discretization (BoSSS). While the transient rise height shows excellent agreement between the different implementations, the velocity fields at the interface demonstrate a different level of local accuracy of the available approaches. Reducing the slip length reduces the overall dynamics of the system, thus yielding a qualitative change in the rise behavior – a behavior that is not covered by simplified ODE models.

In the presence of the capillary rise dynamics, it is obligatory to know the dominant forces. The assumptions considered to solve the capillary rise motion usually neglect specific forces, which limit the reliability of the derived solutions. In the present study, the dominant forces and regimes involved in the initial moments of the capillary rise imbibition process in a tube were investigated analytically, experimentally, and numerically. Analytical solutions available in the literature were discussed, and then, their validity was verified by comparing them to experimental observations and numerical results. Comparing the capillary rise behavior at the initial stages revealed significant differences between the theoretical models and the numerical lattice Boltzmann method. This behavior is attributed to simplify assumptions and ignore the entrance effect, dynamic contact angle, and the inertial term in the theoretical model. By removing these assumptions in numerical formulations, closer results to the experimental records were observed. In the present study, for the first time, capillary rise dynamics were divided into five steps: (1) a transition regime with h ∼ t2, (2) purely inertial (stage one) with h ∼ t, (3) viscous-inertial or crossover (stage two) with h ∼ log10(t), (4) purely viscous (stage three) with h ∼ t1/2, and (5) gravitational-viscous with constant h. It was known that stage one was purely dominated by the inertial forces, then the influence of viscosity increased (viscous-inertial flow), and finally, the effect of inertia faded and the flow became purely viscous and approached the Lucas–Washburn law.}",

Although porous media generally have a complex structure, they can be modeled as a single, vertical capillary or as an assembly of such capillaries. The main difficulties lie in separately estimating the effective mean radius of the capillaries and the contact angle between the liquid and the pore. In this paper we circumvent these obstacles by exploring another approach and suggest an analytical approach of the classical Lucas–Washburn equation (LWE). Specifically, we consider that the contact angle between the liquid meniscus and the inner surface of the capillary becomes a dynamic contact angle when the liquid front is in movement. It has previously been demonstrated that the resulting time dependence is due to frictional dissipation at the moving wetting front.}

abstract = {In this paper, the interaction characteristics between the gaseous detonation and the water droplet are numerically investigated, utilizing a modified compressible two-phase flow model coupling with detailed hydrogen-oxygen chemistry. Firstly, an analysis is conducted on the propagation behaviors of the cellular detonation obstructed by the droplet. It is found that the cellular detonation undergoes reflection, diffraction, local extinction, and re-ignition upon the obstruction, and these behaviors vary with the droplet relative positioning with multi-dimensional structures of the cellular detonation, particularly in terms of the extinction degree caused by the diffraction and the relative positioning of the re-ignition region. Further, the droplet deformation characteristics are detailly analyzed. It has been revealed that the deformation behavior of the shocked droplet under planar detonation is consistent with that under high-speed airflow. However, for the droplet shocked by the cellular detonation, several windward surface pits are induced due to impaction from transverse shocks and direct hitting of the triple-point. The emergence of these pits notably precedes the onset of surface instabilities caused by high-speed airflow erosion. Further investigation has revealed that post-detonation flow, through the entrainment effect of the central pit, progressively penetrates and segregates the droplet into upper and lower segments, and this penetrating effect heavily depends on the droplet relative positioning. Moreover, the side pit, whose presence is significantly determined by whether there is direct impaction of the triple-point on the droplet windward side, is crucial for the deformation around the droplet equator and the subsequent shedding of smaller droplets.}

ABSTRACT = {Infiltration of molten calcium–magnesium–alumina–silicates (CMAS) through thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) causes structural degradation of TBC layers. The infiltration kinetics can be altered by careful tailoring of the electron beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD) microstructure such as feather arm lengths and inter-columnar gaps, etc. Morphology of the feathery columns and their inherent porosities directly influences the infiltration kinetics of molten CMAS. To understand the influence of columnar morphology on the kinetics of the CAMS flow, a finite element based parametric model was developed for describing a variety of EB-PVD top coat microstructures. A detailed numerical study was performed considering fluid-solid interactions (FSI) between the CMAS and TBC top coat (TC). The CMAS flow characteristics through these microstructures were assessed quantitatively and qualitatively. Finally, correlations between the morphological parameters and CMAS flow kinetics were established. It was shown that the rate of longitudinal and lateral infiltration could be minimized by reducing the gap between columns and increasing the length of the feather arms. The results also show that the microstructures with long feather arms having a lower lateral inclination decrease the CMAS infiltration rate, therefore, reduce the CMAS infiltration depth. The analyses allow the identification of key morphological features that are important for mitigating the CMAS infiltration.},

The average Vicker's hardness numbers were found to increase with increasing total number of layers and ranged from 3215 VHN0.050 to 3726 VHN0.050 and 3294 VHN0.050 to 3991 VHN0.050 for the 4 μm and 14 μm thick multilayer TiB2/TiC coatings, respectively. The adhesion of the multilayer coatings was found to be greater than 50 N for a 4 μm thick film and less than 30 N for the thicker films. The degree of crystallographic texture was found to change with varying total number of layers, as well as the orientation of both materials within the multilayer system. The grain size and amount of residual compressive stress was found to decrease with increasing number of layers. In addition, the fracture toughness was found to decrease with increasing total number of layers. This paper discusses the effect of changing the individual layer thickness (i.e. total number of layers) for TiC/TiB2 multilayer coatings deposited on WC-6wt.%Co-0.3wt.%TaC cutting inserts on the average Vicker's hardness number, 2 adhesion, stress, fracture toughness, argon impurities, average crystallite size, crystallographic texture, surface morphology and microstructure using a variety of characterization techniques.",

abstract = {When a turbine airfoil attains temperatures that allow calcium–magnesium–alumino-silicate (CMAS) infiltration into the thermal barrier coating (TBC), a new mechanism of in-service spalling may be activated. The mechanism is associated with cold shock of the infiltrated layer during shut down. It has been identified by inspecting an airfoil removed from service. The identification has been based on observations of sub-surface delaminations within infiltrated regions of the TBC. Three important aspects of the mechanism are as follows. (a) The sub-surface delaminations always initiate at surface-connected vertical separations. (b) They are fully-infiltrated with CMAS. (c) They are strictly mode I. A thermal shock analysis has been invoked to identify a critical infiltration thickness, above which delaminations are possible. The analysis also defines a characteristic depth beneath the surface at which the delaminations are most likely. The observations made on the airfoils are consistent with these two dimensions. A second mechanism has been explored as the potential cause of large spalled regions also observed on the airfoils. But it has not been possible to verify the mechanism using the current observations.}

The assessment has been conducted on stationary components (especially shrouds) with relatively thick TBCs after removal from aero-engines. In those segments that experience the highest temperatures, the CMAS melts, penetrates to a depth about half the coating thickness, and infiltrates all open areas. Therein the TBC develops channel cracks and sub-surface delaminations, as well as spalls. Estimates of the residual stress gradients made on cross-sections (by using the Raman peak shift) indicate tension at the surface, becoming compressive below. By invoking mechanics relevant to the thermo-elastic stresses upon cooling, as well as the propagation of channel cracks and delaminations, a scenario has been presented that rationalizes these experimental findings. Self-consistent estimates of the stress and temperature gradients are presented as well as predictions of channel cracking and delamination upon cooling.}

In this paper, the microstructure and thermo-physical and mechanical properties of plasma sprayed YSZ coatings under the condition of calcium–magnesium–alumina–silicate (CMAS) deposits were investigated. Si and Ca in the CMAS rapidly penetrated the coating at 1250°C and accelerated sintering of the coating. At the interface between the CMAS and YSZ coating, the YSZ coating was partially dissolved in the CMAS, inducing the phase transformation from tetragonal phase to monoclinic phase. Also, the porosity of the coating was reduced from ∼25% to 5%. As a result, the thermal diffusivity at 1200°C increased from 0.3mm2/s to 0.7mm2/s, suggesting a significant degradation in the thermal barrier effect. Also, the coating showed a ∼40% increase in the microhardness. The degradation mechanism of TBC induced by CMAS was discussed.}

abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms by which the durability and functionality of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are compromised by the infiltration of molten calcium–magnesium alumino-silicates (CMAS) requires an assessment of the effects on the thermal and mechanical properties of the coating. This study focuses on quantifying the effect of CMAS on the thermal properties and heat transport in TBCs. The thermal properties of a 7wt.% yttria-stabilized zirconia (7YSZ) TBC deposited on a superalloy substrate by air plasma spray (APS) were measured before and after CMAS infiltration. A rise in both volumetric heat capacity and thermal conductivity of the coating was observed upon infiltration. Calculations to explain these trends were performed for a model TBC system and found to be in good agreement with the measured results. The evolution of the phase constitution of the coating was analyzed by Raman spectroscopy and the integrity of the interface was characterized by optical examination of cross sections. These tests determined that the coating remained in good contact with the substrate and experienced no phase change after infiltration.}

The error is estimated with power series expansions as a function of the typical cell size. These expansions, of which four types are used, are fitted to the data in the least-squares sense. The selection of the best error estimate is based on the standard deviation of the fits. The error estimate is converted into an uncertainty with a safety factor that depends on the observed order of grid convergence and on the standard deviation of the fit. For well-behaved data sets, i.e. monotonic convergence with the expected observed order of grid convergence and no scatter in the data, the method reduces to the well known Grid Convergence Index. Examples of application of the procedure are included.}

Recently, a new failure mode of TBCs caused by calcium–magnesium–alumina–silicate (CMAS) glass has attracted increasing attention. In this paper, yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) TBCs produced by electron beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD) were exposed to CMAS deposits at 1250°C. The microstructure evolution and failure mechanism of the coatings were investigated. It has been shown that CMAS glass penetrated into the YSZ ceramic layer along the inter-columnar gaps and interacted with YSZ. As a result, an interaction zone of about 20μm thickness, which was the mixture of CMAS and YSZ with equiaxial structure, was formed in the YSZ surface layer after 4h heat-treatment at 1250°C. Meanwhile, yttria in YSZ layer as a stabilizer was dissolved in CMAS glass and caused accelerated monoclinic phase transformation. After 8h heat-treatment, degradation of YSZ TBC occurred by delamination cracking of YSZ layer, which is quite different from the traditional failure caused by interfacial cracking at the YSZ/metallic bond coat. Physical models have been built to describe the failure mechanism of EB-PVD TBCs attacked by CMAS deposits.},

   abstract = {Over the last decade a significant amount of research has been conducted into the durability of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) focusing mainly on issues of oxidation, erosion and foreign object damage (FOD). However, as the performance and durability of TBCs has improved the temperatures at which they operate has increased. This increase in temperature has resulted in another lifing issue for EB PVD TBCs, namely that of CMAS attack. Calcium–magnesium–alumino-silicate (CMAS) attack occurs when atmospheric dust that has deposited on the surface of turbine blades melts and wicks into the columns of the TBC. This occurs at temperatures above 1240–1260°C and results in the degradation of the columnar microstructure of the TBCs. Due to the fact that TBCs operate in a temperature gradient CMAS only infiltrates part of the coating before solidifying. There are a number of issues associated with CMAS attack, both chemical and mechanical. From a chemical point of view CMAS attack of electron beam (EB) physical vapour deposited (PVD) TBCs can be considered as a form of corrosion; when there is a lot of excess CMAS on the surface of a coated component Yttria diffuses out of the TBC into the molten CMAS resulting in a t′ to monoclinic phase transformation in the yttria stabilised zirconia (YSZ), CMAS attack also results in localised melting and subsequent re-precipitation of the coating resulting in a loss of the defined columnar microstructure. While from a mechanical point of view the CMAS, once re-solidified, reduces the strain compliance of the EB PVD and can result in spallation of the TBC on cooling. Furthermore, current studies have indicated that small amount of CMAS infiltration significantly increases the erosion rate of EB PVD TBCs. This paper covers various aspects of CMAS attack of EB PVD TBCs, specifically looking at minimum levels of CMAS required to initiate damage, as well as investigating it from an erosion–corrosion perspective.},

We also report the enthalpy of mixing between the coatings and molten silicate after combining the results measured by high-temperature solution calorimetry with enthalpies of fusion measured by drop-and-catch calorimetry and differential thermal analysis. The enthalpies of solution of selected silicate and zirconia-based coatings and apatite reaction products are moderately positive except for 7YSZ, yttria-stabilized zirconia. Apatite formation is only favorable over coating dissolution in terms of enthalpy for 7YSZ. The enthalpies of mixing between the coatings and the molten silicate are less exothermic for Yb2Si2O7 and CaYb4Si3O13 than for 7YSZ, indicating lower energetic stability of the latter against molten silicate corrosion. The thermochemical results explain and support the very corrosive nature of CMAS melts in contact with ceramic coatings.},

CMAS infiltrates into TBC at high temperatures and stiffens the TBC which ultimately loses its strain tolerance and gets delaminated. The EB-PVD technique is used to coat TBCs exhibiting a columnar microstructure on parts such as blades and on vanes. By varying the EB-PVD process parameters, columnar morphology and porosity of the 7YSZ coating is changed and its effect on the CMAS infiltration behaviour is studied in detail. Two different TBC pore geometries were created and infiltration experiments were carried out at 1250°C and 1225°C for different time intervals. The 7YSZ coating with more ‘feathery’ features has resulted in higher CMAS resistance by at least by a factor of 2 than its less ‘feathery’ counterpart.

CMAS ingestion process can erode compressor blades, erode/infiltration thermal barrier coatings, and lead to overheating and stall. To better understand the physical details, this paper presents a novel approach to exploring individual CMAS dynamics in the context of melting particles. The methodology was accomplished by resolving the details of a single CMAS particle using the volume-of-fluid method. To account for thermal properties of the flow and particle, melting-solidification modeling was implemented. The particle was initialized at a stagnant condition with a temperature under its solidus temperature. The flow around the particle was initialized at turbine relevant conditions, including high velocities and temperatures above the particle’s liquidus temperature. Transient conditions were explored in context of non-dimensional numbers (including slip Reynold’s Number, Weber number, and Ohnesorge number), as well as several ratios (ρs/ρg and Ts/T∞). For validation, sensitivity to mesh and input, as well as experimental comparisons were examined. The experimental comparison benchmarked the temperature ratio of particles at varying thermal Stokes numbers against the experimental correlation shown in Bojdo et al. [1].},

abstract = {The strain tolerance of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) used in gas turbine engines is enhanced by incorporation of through-thickness pores within the coating. However, molten calcium–magnesium–alumino–silicate (CMAS) deposits are then able to permeate through the interconnected pore network resulting in dissolution of the coating in the silicate melt, precipitation of new phases, and the elimination of the pores needed for strain tolerance when silicate melt solidification occurs upon cooling. Here we used an electron beam directed vapor deposition method to deposit strain tolerant coatings containing a high volume fraction of inter-columnar pores to assess the effect of increasing the pore volume fraction upon silicate melt infiltration in a 7wt.% yttria stabilized zirconia (7YSZ) TBC. We then explore two potential mitigation approaches. One investigated the infiltration of a samarium zirconate (SZO) coating deposited on a 7wt.% yttria stabilized zirconia (7YSZ) buffer layer since recent work has indicated the related gadolinium zirconate (GZO) system was much more CMAS resistant than 7YSZ. The second explored the effects of an embedded platinum layer located near the outer surface of the SZO layer. The response of both systems to attack by a model 33CaO–9MgO–13AlO1.5–45SiO2 CMAS melt at 1250°C has been compared to that of the 7YSZ composition coating deposited by the same process. The 7YSZ specimens were fully infiltrated by CMAS in less than 1min and significantly dissolved and re-precipitated a globular phase after 4h of exposure. The penetration rate in SZO coatings was reduced by about a factor of five, but the coatings were still completely penetrated after a 4hour exposure. Significant SZO dissolution and precipitation of both globular fluorite and faceted apatite phases were observed after the 4h of exposure, with concomitant debonding at the SZO/YSZ interface. The insertion of a 5μm thick Pt layer about 30μm below the SZO surface arrested permeation of CMAS for about 16h and might provide a promising strategy for controlling CMAS degradation in TBCs without reducing the thermo-cyclic delamination resistance.}

   abstract = {Two standard 7YSZ coatings were deposited by EB-PVD techniques and tested against CMAS infiltration at short time intervals (up to 8 min.) at 1250 °C in air. They exhibited different microstructures, i.e. porosities and microstructural features. Two species of CMAS with different compositions were used and their viscosities were determined using the concentric cylinder method and their contact angles were measured using high temperature heating microscopy. The theoretical viscosities, which were calculated using a statistical model based on the chemical composition of the melts, differed from the measured values of the viscosities by one order of magnitude. A large variation in the contact angles within a very short range of temperature (1243–1266 °C) was observed as well. The porosity and surface area measurements were performed on both EB-PVD microstructures using the nitrogen physisorption method. Additionally, the produced coatings exhibited porosities of 14.5 and 29.5 percent and the infiltration experiments have shown that the more porous coating provides higher infiltration resistance. The effect of porosity on CMAS infiltration kinetics was investigated and the results elucidate that the porosity network plays a more preeminent role than the amount of porosity. The experimental infiltration results have been compared with calculated infiltration data using a novel mathematical approach proposed in previous studies in which the permeability of the coatings is assessed with two contrasting methods termed “concentric pipe” and “open pipe” models. The infiltration was calculated by incorporating the experimentally determined properties such as contact angle, viscosity and porosity. A fitting parameter has been derived from the equations for the geometry factor for both microstructures. The calculated and experimental results are in good agreement with the concentric pipe model supporting the validity of this CMAS infiltration model.},

A batch of as-received desert sand was melted into calcium magnesium aluminosilicate (CMAS) glass at ~1500°C.

Various physical, thermal, and mechanical properties of the glass have been evaluated. Bulk density of CMAS glass was 2.69g/cm3, Young׳s modulus 92GPa, Shear modulus 36GPa, Poisson׳s ratio 0.28, dilatometric glass transition temperature (Tg) 706°C, softening point (Td) 764°C, Vickers microhardness 6.3±0.4GPa, indentation fracture toughness 0.75±0.15MPa.m1/2, and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) 9.8×10−6/°C in the temperature range 25 to 700°C. Temperature dependence of viscosity has also been estimated from various reference points of the CMAS glass using the Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman (VFT) equation as well as from the glass composition. The glass remained amorphous after heat treating at 850°C for 10h but crystallized into CaSiO3 and Ca2Mg0.5AlSi1.5O7 phases at 900°C or higher temperatures. Crystallization kinetics of the CMAS glass has also been investigated by differential thermal analysis (DTA).}

The thermal diffusivity and conductivity of the coating were evaluated non-destructively based on the analysis of its photothermal infrared emission. Although the coating density does not increase significantly with thermal cycling, the thermal diffusivity and conductivity of the coating increased substantially, particularly during the first 20 1h cycles. The values then approach a limiting value. Complementary Raman spectroscopy suggests that the increase is accompanied by a reduction in the defect concentration in the coating and that there is also a correlation between the width of the Raman lines and the thermal conductivity.}

Sessile droplet models are presented and used to compute the contact angle at high temperatures and compared with experiments. The study also investigates the sensitivity of deposition patterns to the Stokes number and the results identify local vulnerability regions.

   abstract = {The viscosity of silicate melts controls magma transport dynamics, eruption style and rates of physicochemical processes (e.g., degassing, crystallization) in natural magmas. Thus a comprehensive viscosity model for magmatic liquids has long been a goal of earth scientists. Here we present a model that predicts the non-Arrhenian Newtonian viscosity of silicate melts as a function of T and melt composition, including the rheologically important volatile constituents H2O and F. Our model is based on >1770 measurements of viscosity on multicomponent anhydrous and volatile-rich silicate melts. The non-Arrhenian T-dependence of viscosity is accounted for by the VFT equation [log η=A+B/(T(K)−C)]. The optimization assumes a common, high-T limit (A) for silicate melt viscosity and returns a value for this limit of −4.55 (+0.2) (e.g., log η~10−4.6 Pa s). All compositional dependence is ascribed to the parameters B and C and is accounted for by an additional 17 model coefficients. Our model is continuous in composition- and temperature-space and predicts the viscosity of natural volatile-bearing silicate melts (SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, FeOtot, CaO, MgO, MnO, Na2O, K2O, P2O5, H2O, F2O−1) over fifteen log units of viscosity (10−1–1014 Pa s). The model for viscosity can also predict other transport properties including glass transition temperatures (Tg) and melt fragility (m). We show strong systematic decreases in Tg and m with increasing volatile content. This pattern has implications for predicting styles of volcanic eruption and understanding silicate melt structure. Our model transforms a quarter-century of experimental study of melt viscosities, into a parameterisation having a predictive capacity that makes it relevant to diverse fields of research including: volcanology, geophysics, petrology and material sciences.},

   abstract = {View Video Presentation: https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2023-0179.vidSand and volcanic ash may be ingested into an aircraft engine during operation in regions where these materials are abundant. These calcium-magnesium-aluminosilicate (CMAS) compositions infiltrate into high temperature electron-beam physical vapor deposited (EB-PVD) ceramic thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). CMAS interacts both thermochemically and thermomechanically with the ceramic coating. Of the possible phases that originate from transformations that take place during the interaction, the monoclinic phase is associated with a volumetric expansion, introducing additional stresses to the coating system and promoting micro-crack initiation. It is therefore vital to elucidate the complementary nature between the thermochemical and thermomechanical mechanisms influencing the residual stress for better coating and CMAS-related degradation monitoring. This work compares results and draws connections from outcomes of previous efforts using 3D confocal Raman spectroscopy to non-destructively evaluate localized, microscale, coating degradation of standard EB-PVD 7YSZ TBCs due to CMAS attack. Preliminary CFD simulations also provide the opportunity to evaluate microstructural effects on CMAS infiltration and infiltration rate. The larger picture of coating degradation monitoring is used to suggest mitigation strategies to prevent premature coating failure with a future outlook toward CFD simulation studies. The ability to non-destructively capture this degradation and represent the associated probed volume will lead towards better damage monitoring as well as aid in the development and implementation of more CMAS-resistant coatings and additional mitigation strategies.},

Several interface tracking methods can be found in literature: the level-set method, the marker particle method, the front tracking method and the volume of fluid method (VOF) to name a few. The volume of fluid method has an advantage of being conceptually simple, reasonably accurate and phenomena such as interface breakup and coalescence are inherently included. Over the years a number of different techniques to implement the VOF method have been devised. This article gives a basic introduction to the VOF method and focuses on four VOF methods: flux-corrected transport (FCT) by Boris et al. [J.P. Boris, D.L. Book, Flux-corrected transport. I: SHASTA, a fluid transport algorithm that works, J. Comput. Phys. 11 (1973) 38–69], Lagrangian piecewise linear interface construction (L-PLIC) by van Wachem and Schouten [B.G.M. van Wachem, J.C.

A detailed description of these schemes is given and implemented into an in-house fully coupled solver. Further, the performance of these schemes is examined employing a number of tests to analyze their strengths and weaknesses. Their advantages and limitations are discussed.}

abstract = {The U.S. Army AMRDEC has been performing research focusing on both analytical modeling and obtaining validation data through experimentation. The focus of this research is to understand both the impact event, and the associated material damage mechanisms. A key aspect of weather encounter modeling is that the local vehicle flow field environment alters the impact boundary conditions with time. Therefore, an analytical model must be able to include not only the vehicle flow field, but also the time accurate embedded flow field surrounding the droplets as they alter shape prior to impact. The impact event is highly dependent on the actual droplet shape at impact, and therefore extensive modeling and testing was required to obtain data suitable for code validation. The empirical testing effort consisted of single droplet impacts, high-speed rocket sled testing, and testing in a ballistics range. The data presented focuses on the data collected at the ballistics range for Mach numbers ranging from 2 to 7 for various shapes. The core analytical effort was developed by extensive modifications of the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics C-Code (SPHC) from Stellingwerf Consulting, augmented with an improved water equation of state that included the supercooled regime to augment the fidelity of the impact physics for rain drops at high altitudes. The analytical model demonstrates that the temporal distortion of water in a post-shock environment and the impact events for various projectiles can be captured with reasonable accuracy. The next step is to obtain data within the shock layers of relevant vehicle shapes in order to obtain the detailed demise and coupled flow field physics in order to validate the model in a realistic environment. The data presented reveals the droplet shape change and demise characteristics inside the shock structures for missile domes and sphere-cone designs, along with the complex embedded shock structure and impact physics associated with these events. This data forms a subset of empirical data that can be used for the fully-coupled full-scale impact events on flight vehicles.}

Leveraging the massive computational resources available at LLNL we simulate the drag response of a hypersonic vehicle to rain with first-principles physics-based models. These 2D simulations were performed using a multi-component CFD code equipped with a supercooled water EOS and an immersed boundary method. The dynamics of drop demise show good agreement with prior experimental work. The hypersonic vehicle exhibits an oscillating drag response when subjected to a single drop due to a rippling effect of the raindrop residue in the post-shock region. The drag response to multiple drops is far more intense with a longer oscillating wavelength implying that results from single drop encounters may not be suggestive of a realistic vehicle response to a rainstorm. Future work should analyze the dynamics of the drag response, extend the simulations to 3D, and attempt to validate against future sled track experiments. }

    abstract = { This investigation centers on the dynamics of droplet breakup influenced by cavitation under high-velocity shock waves, utilizing detailed multiphase computations through Star-CCM+. The study specifically models the interaction of Mach 2.4 and Mach 5 shock waves with 2mm diameter droplets, employing the Volume-of-Fluid and Full Rayleigh-Plesset cavitation models. Two distinct simulation scenarios were examined: a cavitating scenario using a seed density of 1*10^12 m^-3 and a seed radius of 2.3*10^-5 m, and a non-cavitating scenario with a seed density of 1*10^7 m^-3 and a seed radius of 1*10^-7 m. The results indicate that at Mach 2.4, below the critical cavitation Mach number, the impact of cavitation on droplet breakup is minimal, with a cavitating volume fraction of merely 1.9*10^-3. In this regime, the breakup is primarily influenced by surface phenomena, such as sheet stripping. However, at Mach 5, above the critical threshold, the cavitation effect becomes substantial, with a maximum vapor volume fraction of 0.327, significantly altering the droplet's behavior. This scenario suggests the potential initiation of jetting processes, frequently observed in droplet cavitation applications. The study provides insights into the immediate consequences of shock wave-induced cavitation on droplets, elucidating the complex interplay between cavitation, droplet deformation, and breakup patterns. Future work will focus on increasing the cavitation volume fraction for a more accurate representation of droplet behavior during atmospheric entry. The model will be expanded to include a wider range of wave speeds and to examine interactions with both normal and oblique shocks. These advancements are expected to deepen the understanding of droplet-vehicle interactions in high-speed aerodynamic environments, particularly in the context of varying shock wave intensities and orientations. }

    abstract = { Shock droplet interactions are found in a wide range of applications, ranging from liquid- fueled detonation engines to droplet interactions with high-speed vehicles and detonation mitigation. However, the physical understanding and modeling of such multiphase detonations are hampered by a lack of models for droplet break after a shock or detonation. Experimental studies of this problem are available but can only measure macroscopic properties and cannot resolve the quantitative details at small scales. High-fidelity numerical studies are needed to understand the break-up process better. The current study will use fully-resolved simulations of Mach 3, 4, and 5 shock waves interacting with a 100 micro meter water droplet. The post-impact primary droplet and the secondary shed droplet radius are computed and found to have a log-normal distribution. To the author’s knowledge, this is the first high-fidelity study of shock-droplet interactions that captures the shed-droplet distribution. }

Stewart, Two-phase modeling of deflagration-to-detonation transition in granular materials: reduced equations, Physics of Fluids 13(10) (2001) 3002–3024] is examined. This model has shown excellent capabilities for the numerical resolution of interfaces separating compressible fluids as well as wave propagation in compressible mixtures [A. Murrone, H.

The artificial heat exchange for multiphase shocks, Journal of Computational Physics 225(2) (2007) 2214–2248]. However, its numerical approximation poses some serious difficulties. Among them, the non-monotonic behavior of the sound speed causes inaccuracies in wave’s transmission across interfaces. Moreover, volume fraction variation across acoustic waves results in difficulties for the Riemann problem resolution, and in particular for the derivation of approximate solvers. Volume fraction positivity in the presence of shocks or strong expansion waves is another issue resulting in lack of robustness. To circumvent these difficulties, the pressure equilibrium assumption is relaxed and a pressure non-equilibrium model is developed. It results in a single velocity, non-conservative hyperbolic model with two energy equations involving relaxation terms. It fulfills the equation of state and energy conservation on both sides of interfaces and guarantees correct transmission of shocks across them. This formulation considerably simplifies numerical resolution. Following a strategy developed previously for another flow model [R. Saurel, R. Abgrall, A multiphase Godunov method for multifluid and multiphase flows, Journal of Computational Physics 150 (1999) 425–467], the hyperbolic part is first solved without relaxation terms with a simple, fast and robust algorithm, valid for unstructured meshes. Second, stiff relaxation terms are solved with a Newton method that also guarantees positivity and robustness. The algorithm and model are compared to exact solutions of the Euler equations as well as solutions of the five-equation model under extreme flow conditions, for interface computation and cavitating flows involving dynamics appearance of interfaces. In order to deal with correct dynamic of shock waves propagating through multiphase mixtures, the artificial heat exchange method of Petitpas et al. [F. Petitpas, E. Franquet, R. Saurel, O. Le Metayer, A relaxation-projection method for compressible flows. Part II. The artificial heat exchange for multiphase shocks, Journal of Computational Physics 225(2) (2007) 2214–2248] is adapted to the present formulation.}

abstract = {Underwater explosions present many challenges for numerical modeling. The density ratio between explosion gases and the surrounding liquid are typically O(103), and the pressure ratios can be just as high. We develop a cell-centered finite volume method to solve the governing equations of a two-phase homogeneous fluid. Isentropic and isothermal equations of state are used to relate densities and pressure, in lieu of solving an energy equation. A volume fraction is used to distinguish between the disparate phases. A pressure-based, segregated algebraic solution procedure is used to solve for the primitive variables representing volume fraction, velocity, and piezometric pressure. Numerical examples include verification and validation for a number of canonical test cases. In particular, we examine an advecting material interface and show the absence of pressure oscillations across the contact discontinuity. The non-conservative form of our equations does not guarantee exact mass balance, but numerical experiments indicate that this dissipative mechanism has a stabilizing affect on the method. Shock tube and axisymmetric underwater explosion problems are presented to demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm when very large density and pressure discontinuities are present. We simulate a shallow water explosion in three dimensions and examine the effects on the free surface and explosion bubble topology.}

    abstract = "{A computational study of the wave phenomenon and probable cavitation that occurs when a droplet interacts with a shock is presented. A volume-of-fluid method with and without a cavitation model activated is employed. The model with no cavitation is used to clarify the droplet's internal wave field. The model is benchmarked using experimental data of a 22 mm water column impacted by a shock wave at Mach 2.4. Good agreement between the computational results for a two-dimensional (2D) circular droplet and the experimental results is demonstrated. A simplified 2D, square droplet is also considered in order to highlight the effects of interface curvature on the internal waves. Comparison of the results for the square and circular drops shows that the circular geometry diffuses the initial pressure wave while focusing the reflected wave. The three-dimensional (3D) spherical droplet was then analyzed. The internal wave behavior is similar to the 2D circular drop with enhanced diffusion and focusing. Two cavitation models were then used to explore the probability that cavitation occurs for a nominal sized raindrop interacting with shock waves, Mach 1.5–5. Two cavitation models, full Rayleigh–Plesset (FRP) and Schnerr-Sauer both predicted vapor formation at the same location with the FRP always predicting slightly higher amounts of vapor. The current setting for number of nuclei ensures that the simulation is not swamped by vapor formation but is unrealistically small. Therefore, while the work demonstrates that cavitation will occur, the full nature of the cavitation along with the impulsive pressure waves it should create is not currently captured.}",

abstract = {Liquid droplet impingement (LDI) erosion could be regarded to be one of the major causes of unexpected troubles occasionally occurred in the inner bent pipe surface. Evaluating the LDI erosion is an important topic of the thermal hydraulics and structural integrity in aging and life extension for nuclear power plants. One of the causes of LDI erosion is the impact pressure by the impingement of droplets in the involved steam. We investigated a simple droplet impingement to a rigid wall using volume of fluid (VOF) model, which is a two-phase Eulerian–Eulerian approach. The impact of a single water droplet with a high velocity towards a solid surface is examined numerically. The high Reynolds number value implies inertia dominated the phenomena and supports an inviscid approach to the problem. The high Weber number is justifying that an assumption to neglect the surface tension effect is adopted. We show that the compressibility of the liquid medium plays a dominant role in the evolution of the phenomenon. Both generation and propagation of shock waves are directly computed by solving the fluid dynamics continuity and momentum equations. In the simulation we employed a front tracking solution procedure, which is particularly suitable for two-phase free surface computation. The numerical results show that critical maximum pressure is not highest at the center of droplet contact on the surface at the first instantaneous moment but highest behind the contact angle later before jet eruption. It agrees generally well (within 20%) with the mathematical analysis. Finally, a droplet impact angle function is proposed for the global LDI erosion prediction.}

   abstract = {A detailed theoretical model of capillary transport in rectangular microchannels is proposed. Two important aspects of capillary transport are revisited, which are considered with simplified assumption in the literature. The capillary flow is assumed as a low Reynolds number flow and hence creeping flow assumptions are considered for majority of analyses. The velocity profile used with this assumption results into a steady state fully developed velocity profile. The capillary flow is inherently a transient process. In this study, the capillary flow analysis is performed with transient velocity profile. The pressure field expression at the entrance of the microchannel is another aspect which is not often accurately represented in the literature. The approximated pressure field expression at the entrance of the rectangular microchannel is widely used in the literature. An appropriate entrance pressure field expression for a rectangular microchannel is proposed. For both analyses, the governing equation of the capillary transport in rectangular microchannel is derived by applying the momentum equation to the fluid control volume along the microchannel. The non-dimensional governing equations are obtained, each for a transient velocity profile and a newly proposed pressure field, for analyzing the importance of such velocity profile and pressure field expression.},

    abstract = "{Spontaneous spreading of a liquid droplet upon a cold solid surface is ubiquitous in nature as well as critical to many industrial technologies, while the mechanism of which still remains elusive. The role of surface subcooling in a water droplet spreading behavior upon impacting on a smooth silicon surface has been experimentally investigated. Under the subcooling condition of the substrate, in the low Weber number region, the non-dimensional maximum spreading diameter decreases with the surface subcooling due to a larger viscosity dissipation and higher surface tension. However, in the case of a high Weber number, the maximum spreading factor first descends and then increases with the increasing surface subcooling. This non-monotonic tendency is attributed to the competition between the increased maximum fingering length and the reduced maximum interior spreading diameter with an increase of the surface subcooling. A sufficiently large Weber number is the prerequisite for forming fingering patterns, and a high subcooling reinforces them due to the enhanced deceleration caused by a larger surface tension and viscosity. The time at maximum spreading barely changes with the impact velocity and slightly decreases with the surface subcooling depending on the droplet size. An improved correlation of the time at maximum spreading as a function of the maximum spreading factor, droplet size, impact velocity, and surface subcooling is proposed.}",
